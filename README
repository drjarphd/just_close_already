The day is done. Its time to go. Everything needs to shut down NOW. 
This is a batch file which closes almost any program that Austin might be using to expediate leaving work on time.
This also starts a restart timer set for thirty minutes just in case someone decides to walk in just as Austin is 
getting ready to leave and needs to access something.

This program is intended for Austin's who hate spending a long time closing things on a 32bit machine.
